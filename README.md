# LearningRust
A collection of programs in Rust for exploring the language.


-Learned some basics, including cargo, the package manager. 

-Everything is immutable by default! Lot of emphasis on safety, which is in line with what I've been told.

-C style references

-Strong static typing in function definitions

-Core values: speed, safety, concurrency

-Ownership: Each value can only have one owner, one object.
